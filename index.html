                My name is Levi Omagbemi, I was born in Warri, Delta State, Nigeria. I am a passionate software engineering student with a strong interest in technology. I have a proficiency in web development, and programming. My expertise includes working with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Vue.js, Python, and frameworks like Django, and Tailwind CSS.

                Beyond academics, I am dedicated to fostering growth in the tech community, mentoring others, and exploring emerging technologies like robotics and digital product creation. My goal is to develop innovative solutions that bridge creativity and technology while inspiring others to do the same.

                  Warri is a lively city in the southern part of Nigeria, located in Delta State. Known for its energetic people, unique blend of cultures, and strong presence in the oil industry, Warri holds an important place in the Niger Delta region. The city sits along the Warri River and has a long history that dates back to early trade with Europeans, especially the Portuguese. Over time, it grew into a key center for commerce and later became deeply involved in Nigeriaâ€™s oil and gas sector.

                  Warri has produced many notable figures in sports, entertainment, and business, and continues to be a place of ambition and creative energy. Whether through its cultural festivals, street life, or deep-rooted pride in heritage, Warri remains a city that stands out in Nigeriaâ€™s story.
